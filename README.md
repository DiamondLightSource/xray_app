# xraylib app [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DiamondLightSource/xray_app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DiamondLightSource/xray_app)

A web based interface for [xraylib](https://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib).

Built with Python (3.6) bindings for xraylib 3.3.0 in addition to the Flask web framework (and associated libraries Flask-WTF  and WTForms). 
Unit tests were written with pytest and BeautifulSoup 4. 
Bootstrap CSS and the JavaScript library jQuery were used to create a user and mobile friendly interface. Plots and periodic table are generated using Bokeh.
